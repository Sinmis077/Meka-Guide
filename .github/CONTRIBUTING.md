# How to contribute

We welcome any contributions and Pull Requests made to Mekanism.

## Lang file contributions

Please make sure to make any localization Pull Requests target the corresponding modules resource directory, and not the data generators generated resource directory. For example, for the main module lang files would go [here](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/tree/template_update/src/main/resources/assets/mekanism/lang) and [not here](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/tree/template_update/src/datagen/generated/mekanism/assets/mekanism/lang). Unless they are made via a data generator and generated to that location.

## Code contirbutions

While we have not gotten around to setting up a code style for eclipse yet as we are mostly IntelliJ IDEA users, for the most part we use google's java formatting style, modified to four spaces, wider column widths, and less force wrapping. For IntelliJ users you can find the style [here](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/blob/template_update/docs/GoogleStyle4Indents.xml), and information on how to import a code style into IntelliJ can be found [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/settings-code-style.html.
